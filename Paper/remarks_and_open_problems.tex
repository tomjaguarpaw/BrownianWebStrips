\section{Remarks and open problems}

\label{sec:open-problems}

In this paper we present the second known example of a two-dimesional
black noise, after the scaling limit of critical planar percolation,
as proved by Schramm and Smirnov.  In their result they also proved
that \sigfield{}s can be associated to a larger class of domains than
just rectangles in a way that still allows the \sigfield{} of a larger
domain to be recovered from the \sigfield{}s of two smaller domains
that partition it, as long as border between those domains has
Hausdorff dimension strictly less than 5/4.
Additionally they show that this cannot be done when the border has
dimension strictly greater than 5/4.
This raises the following question:

\begin{openproblem}
  To what class of domains can the Brownian web noise be extended?
\end{openproblem}

We suspect the answer to be more sophisticated than for percolation,
since the Brownian web is not rotationally invariant.  
\TODO{}{Check what is known about the web and Schramm-Smirnov}
\TODO{}{Write about different stability on different axes}

\DOTHIS{In particular}{is this the best phrasing?} we would like to ask,

\begin{openproblem}
  Can we demonstrate an explicit example of domains to which the noise
  cannot be extended?
\end{openproblem}

By general results, such domains must exist (see
\cite{tsirelson-nonclassical-stochastic-flows} Theorem 11a2 and
Section 11b).

Furthermore, this discovery calls for seeking more examples of
two-dimensional black noises, and indeed in higher dimensions.  Their
discovery would shed light on the nature of black noises.

\begin{openproblem}
  Find more examples of two-dimensional black noises.  Show an example
  of a black noise in three dimensions or more.
\end{openproblem}
