It will be slightly easier to work with the process $\rotproc =
(\sampled + \resamplede, \sampled - \resamplede)$ which is $(\sampled,
\resamplede)$ rotated by $\pi / 4$ radians, and scaled by a factor of
$\sqrt{2}$.

Fix $\delta > 0$.  Consider the process $\rotproc$ run until it hits
either $A$ or $L^+ \cup L^-$.  We will show that the probability it
hits $A$ first is $O(\epsilon)$.

The only difficulty is that $L^\epsilon$ is sometimes absorbing and
sometimes not.

We analyse $\rotproc$ through the following state machine.  From the
start $S$ the process first hits either $L^- \cup L^+$ or $M$.

The probability of transition from $S$ to $1$ is bounded below by $C$,
say, which can be chosen independently of $\epsilon$, by scale
invariance.

From state $M$ the probability of reaching $A$ before $L^- \cup
L^\epsilon \cup L^+$ is exactly $\epsilon/\delta$.
