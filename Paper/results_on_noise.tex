\section{Conclusions about the noise}
\label{sec:conclusions-about-the-noise}

We conclude by supplying a formal framework for the statement of
Theorem \ref{thm:bw-2d-black-noise} followed by its proof.
The following definition of noise is due to Tsirelson (Definition
3d1 p25 of \cite{tsirelson-nonclassical-stochastic-flows}).

\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}
A $d$-dimensional noise consists of a probability space $(\Omega,F,
\P)$, sub-$\sigma$-fields $\F_R \subset \F$ given for all (open)
$d$-dimensional rectangles $R \subset \R^d$, and a measurable action
$(T_h)_h$ of the additive group of $\R^d$ on $\Omega$, having the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{item:tensor-condition} $\F_R \tensor \F_{R'} = \F_{R''}$ whenever $R''$ is a
rectangle partitioned by rectangles $R$ and $R'$ in the sense that
$R\cap R'=\emptyset$ and the closure of $R \cup R'$
is the closure of $R''$,
\item \label{item:translation-condition} $T_h$ sends $\F_R$ to $\F_{R+h}$ for each $h \in \R^d$,
\item \label{item:generation-condition} $\F$ is generated by the union of all $\F_R$.
\end{enumerate}

In the case of a one-dimensional noise, $R$ ranges over all open intervals
and condition~(\ref{item:tensor-condition}) translates to
$\F_{(s,t)} \tensor \F_{(t,u)} = \F_{(s,u)}$ whenever $s < t < u$.

As conditions (\ref{item:translation-condition}) and
(\ref{item:generation-condition}) are immediate for
horizontal factorization of the Brownian web (see
Definition~\ref{def:horizontal-factorization}),
Theorem~\ref{thm:recoveringfromstrips} immediately
implies the following:

\begin{proposition*}
The Brownian web factorized on horizontal strips is a noise.
\end{proposition*}

We can also extend the definition of the horizontal
factorization of the web, defining a two-dimensional
factorization into rectangles along the lines of the
same definition. As the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:recoveringfromstrips}
holds when restricted to vertical strips, and the proof of its vertical
counterpart holds when restricted to horizontal strips (see \TODO{}{add
ref if possible}), we can extend our results to derive the following:

\begin{proposition*}
The Brownian web, factorized on two-dimensional
rectangles is a two-dimensional noise.
\end{proposition*}

Furthermore, by a completely general and abstract result
of Tsirelson \TODO{}{cite}, a two-dimensional noise which is
black in one of its one-dimensional factorizations is also
black. As this holds for the Brownian web (see \TODO{cite}),
we deduce Theorem \ref{thm:bw-2d-black-noise}.
