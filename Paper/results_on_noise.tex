2dim noise

\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}
A $d$-dimensional noise consists of a probability space $(\Omega,F, \P)$, sub-$\sigma$-fields $\F_R \subset \F$ given for
all (open) $d$-dimensional rectangles $R \subset \R^d$, and a measurable action $(T_h)_h$ of $\R^d$ on, having the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{item:tensor-condition} $\F_R \tensor \F_{R'} = \F_{R''}$ whenever $R''$ is a
rectangle partitioned by rectangles $R$ and $R'$ in the sense that
$R\cap R'=\emptyset$ and the closure of $R \cup R'$
is the closure of $R''$,
\item $T_h$ sends $\F_R$ to $\F_{R+h}$ for each $h \in \R^d$,
\item $\F$ is generated by the union of all $\F_R$.
\end{enumerate}

In the case of a one-dimensional noise, $R$ ranges over all open intervals
and condition (\ref{item:tensor-condition}) translates to
$\F_{(s,t)} \tensor \F_{(t,u)} = \F_{(s,u)}$ whenever $s < t < u$.
