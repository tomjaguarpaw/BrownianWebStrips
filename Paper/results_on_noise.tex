2dim noise

\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}
A noise, or a homogeneous continuous product of probability
spaces, consists of a probability space $(\Omega,F, \P)$, sub-$\sigma$-fields $\F_{s,t} \subset \F$ given for
all $s, t \in \R$, $s < t$, and a measurable action $(T_h)_h$ of $\R$ on, having the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\F_{r,s} \tensor \F_{s,t} = \F_{r,t}$ whenever $r < s < t$ ,
\item $T_h$ sends $\F_{s,t}$ to $\F_{s+h,t+h}$ whenever $s < t$ and $h \in \R$,
\item $\F$ is generated by the union of all $\F_{s,t}$.
\end{enumerate}
