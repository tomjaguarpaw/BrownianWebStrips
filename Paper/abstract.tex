\section{Introduction}
In this paper we study a stochastic object called the \emph{Brownian web}. We
research this object in the context of the theory of classical and
non-classical noises, developed by Boris Tsirelson [] [] []. Our main result
is, that in the terminology of this theory, the Brownian web is a
two-dimensional \emph{black} noise.
 Roughly speaking, the Brownian web is a random variable assigning to
every space-time point in $\R\times\R$, a standard Brownian motion starting
at that point. Each of those motions are independent until they hit each
other, and after that they coalesce, continuing together. This object was
originally studied more then twenty five years ago by Arratia [], motivated
by a study of the asymptotics of one-dimensional voter models, and later on
by T\'{o}th and Werner, motivated by the problem of constructing continuum
``self-repelling motions'', and by Fontes,Isopi, Newman and Ravishankar,
motivated by its relevance to ``aging'' in statistical physics of
one-dimensional coarsening. A rigorous notion of Brownian webs in our context
can be found in \TODO{}{give reference}.

The Brownian web functions as an important example in the theory of classical
and non-classical noises developed by Tsirelson []. In this theory a noise is
roughly a collection of random sigma-fields indexed on subsets of $\R^d$,
distribution is independent on disjoint subsets of $\R^d$, translation
invariant on $\R^d$, and satisfies that for subfield of a $d$-dimensional
rectangle, and for every partition of it to two smaller rectangles, the $\sigma$-field
of the bigger rectangle is measurable in respect to the fields of the
smaller ones. Two natural examples of a noises, are the Gaussian white noise,
and the Poisson noise. Those two noises are called classical, or white,
meaning that
resampling of a small portion of $\R^d$ doesn't change the observables of the
process very much.

The foundational result of Tsirelson and Vershick showed that there
exist non-classical noises.  Indeed there exist non-classical noises
that are as far from white as could be, and these we call black.  The
defining property of a black noise is that all its observables are
unstable, i.e.\ that resampling a small portion of the noise can
render a particular observable nearly independent of its original
value.  (For a more formal discussion of black and white, classical
and non-classical noises see [].  As definitions of black noise are
hard to find we also supply a full definition of a black noise in
the \TODO{appendix}{do the appendix}.)  Later the Brownian web,
when considered as a time-indexed random process,
was shown by Tsirelson in [] to be a one-dimensional black noise.  We
extend this
result by showing that the Brownian web is in fact a two-dimensional
black noise.  Formally:

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bw-2d-black-noise}
The Brownian web is a
two-dimensional black noise.
\end{theorem}

This makes the Brownian web only the second
known two-dimensional black noise after Schramm and Smirnoff's
recent result on the scaling limit of critical planar
percolation \TODO{}{citation}.

Of the three properties required for a process to be a noise, the
first two, i.e.\ translation invariance and independence on disjoint
domains, hold trivially for the Brownian web.  Furthermore, once we
have shown that the Brownian web is a two-dimensional noise, it will
follow that it is a two-dimensional \emph{black} noise, since a
sufficient condition for a two-dimensional noise to be black is that
one of its one-dimensional projections is black.
